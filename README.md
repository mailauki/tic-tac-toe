## mailauki's TicTacToe
This is a website for playing tic-tac-toe, either against the computer or a friend.

Deployed on https://mailauki-tic-tac-toe.netlify.app with Netlify.

## Functionality
* The user can choose between a one player or two player game. The one player game having the computer (JavaScript functions) as the opponent, while the two player game has someone physically nearby as the opponent (or oneself).

* The user can reset the board to start a new game, using either the "reset board" button above the board or the "reset" button in the popup.

* The user can unlock and choose color options for the tokens. Unlocking options is based on the number of wins. The number of wins are tallied for oneself in the one player game and tallied based on the token for the two player game (unlocks individually).
